I got into science via Palaeontology, because I was always interested in how and why evolution changes the shapes of animals over time. I studied Geology as an undergraduate, but during my PhD on biomechanical finite element validation, I realised that palaeontology could benefit from more data about modern animals, and started to drift towards the Biological Sciences; itâ€™s also much easier to study living dinosaurs (birds) than it is to study extinct ones! I joined the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/jen-bright">University of Hull</a> as a lecturer in Zoology in 2019, albeit one with a disproportionately high number of rocks in their office.

I am the Programme Director for the Zoology degree, and module leader for Vertebrate Zoology (core for Zoology and Biology students, and optional for Marine Biologists). For final year Independent Research Project students, I offer projects investigating aspects of animal form and function. Depending on the project this may include learning geometric morphometrics methods or ways of measuring functional performance from skeletons or 3D computer models.
