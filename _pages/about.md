I got into science via Palaeontology, because I was always interested in how and why evolution changes the shapes of animals over time. I studied Geology as an undergraduate, but during my PhD on biomechanical finite element validation, I realised that palaeontology could benefit from more data about modern animals, and started to drift towards the Biological Sciences; itâ€™s also much easier to study living dinosaurs (birds) than it is to study extinct ones! I joined the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/jen-bright">University of Hull</a> as a lecturer in Zoology in 2019, albeit one with a disproportionately high number of rocks in their office.
